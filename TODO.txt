once installed, the following needs automated:

- create the evoke config_site.py
  - with the local mysql connect params

- apps:
  - do we require them to be installed in site_packages - otherwise we need to be very clever with filepaths..
  
  - currently successfully tested deepian with app in root of virtual env (ie same place that site is)
    -  note: non-virtualenv install will install site as /usr/local/site

  - need code to add site subfolder and contents:
    -create app config_site.py: with the site_filepath variable 
    - copy a default favicon.ico to site/<appname>/
    - copy the following (from where?) to site/<appname>/
      - css
      - js
      - images (do we need this???)
    - symlink site/<appnam>/evoke as "../evoke"
    - symlink site/<appname>/data to the actual data folder, wherever that is located..
