state of play
==

{ python3 setup.py bdist_wheel }

The above creates a wheel in the {dist} folder. (also creates {build} folder and {evoke.egg-info} folder).

issues with setup.py
==
- setup.py has to be a level above base (ie in evoke folder)
- it creates a package in python site-packages called "base" 

=> rename base to evoke ?


issues with app folder
==
- no empty data folder in app
- no site folder in app - will have to do away with symbolic links...

=> create-app script and app folders (especially those involving symlinks)  need a rethink


virtualenv
==
In the virtualenv:
- all of the code is in lib/python3.6/site_packages/base (as is app, and evo code)
- site data is in site


other issues
==
- imports will change...
- all references to data will probably change
- there will be a dichotomy between development code and deployed code
  - the git repo holds the development code
    - including setup.py (even if in the wrong location)
  - how about we use a temporary build folder for creating the wheel:
     - copy required base (or evoke) folder into it
     - copy the site folder into it
     - copy the scripts into it
     - link to the setup.py

o/s: apps
==
These will also be installed similarly to site_packages etc via their own wheels - same issues will arise:
- location of setup.py
- problems with symbolic links
- imports will change
- all references to data will probably change
- issues with nested git repos, if we extend the evoke repo to include the enclosing folder...
  - BUT: no reason (other than existing symlink setup, which has to be changed anyway) to locate apps within evoke enclosing folder
