PACKAGING ISSUES
==
- logs currently being written to a log directory created wherever evoke is called from... They should have a standard location eg var/log/<appname>.

BUG
==
- data.list() cannot cope with a "where" parameter for any word(s) starting with s - eg where="%%star%%"
  eg see evoke.Page.page.py line 1152: heads.extend(self.list(where='name like "%%%s%%"' % term,orderby='uid desc'))
  because of evoke.data.py line  402:  whereclauses = (' and '.join(sqlparts)).replace("%","%%").replace('%%s','%s') # double the % wildcard (but not any %s)
  i.e. The substitution of "%%s" is a bodge too far! REVERT TO PRE - SQL INJECTION PROTECTION data.py (ie as per grace 8)
CURRENTLY BODGED BY FORCING UPPERCASE FOR SEARCH TERM IN THIS PARTICULAR EXAMPLE.....


LATER
==
- import/export

- should there be a base EvoType object, even if it only has the __hash__ declaration in it.. ?

- user sessions
    * migrate session table to session cache (CJH)

- flat files are all currently going through validation (not relevant when fielded by apache) (CAN I MAKE THIS SWITCHABLE VIA A CONFIG const?)

- we need to be able to add/override types in apps, so that e.g. lib/TEXT() can be put in Page app (where it belongs)
